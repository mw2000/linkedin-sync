- Step 4: Modify config.ts and add in your client id and client secret.
- Step 5: Reload Obsidian, go to settings -> Linkedin Sync Settings -> Connect
- Step 6: Sign in with your Linkedin Account.

Write your article in a new obsidian file, and once you're done, use the commands tab to find the Post To Linkedin command.

Click on this, and then your entire article will be posted to Linkedin.
